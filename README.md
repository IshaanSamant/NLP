# NLP
Applying the basic concepts of NLP.
This program applies the extractive text summarization concept of NLP.
We calculate the idf and the tdif scores and use these to assign ranks to
each sentence of the paragraph, based on these ranks we can find the sentences
with the highest value(score) and thus find the text summarization of a given
paragraph.
